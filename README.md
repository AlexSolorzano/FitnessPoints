# FitnessPoints
WebApp for 4800

Important files to consider:

1.index.html - dashboard aka home page 
  - you can view all your general stats while also being able to add your calorie intake and exercise intake

2. rewards.html - rewards page
  - you can view your rewards, so maybe hardcode a coupe of images of different stuff like leggins, and shoes etc and maybe add like a feature where you can either have buttons with different types of exercise or something like that and when the user clicks it, options pertaining to that show up. 
  
3. social.html - friends page
  - here the user will be able to view their friends and a little snipit of their profiles. They'll also be able to add friends and challenge them 
  
4. login.html - login page, automatically takes you to the dashboard
5. register.html - creates an account 
6. 404.html - error page, we can add this to any of the buttons we don't want them to press or something
7. sb-admin-2.css - the readible css page

The rest of the html pages, don't really matter but I kept them because they have some really cool elements that I like to grab and use in other pages. Literally just copying and pasting them to use.
